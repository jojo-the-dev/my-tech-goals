                    <h1>MY 2-YEARS TECH PLAN</h1>
                    <p>
                    At the start of the year 2024, I worked on my final year project. 
                    I was clueless on what to do and wasted all my time trying to debug a cloned project
                    from GitHub which I eventually submitted. I got an <i>E</i>.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, despite my frustration while working on the project and subsequent anger
                    after seeing my grade, I realized I loved the hyper-focus I gave to the project
                    and the pride I felt after solving each bug which I often worked on tirelessly for days.
                    <br>
                    <br>I resolved, while working on the project, to continue doing tech for the rest of the year
                    and kept to it even after my grade came out. It is June 30, 2024, and I am in the project
                    phase of Zuri Training, and have reached Stage 1 in HNG Internship.
                    <br>
                    <br>Now, I believe I need to have goals that would guide my tech career for the next two years
                    and have a clear vision of my career path.
                    <br>
                    <br><b><i>Firstly,</i></b> my desire is to develop intensive skills in tech. <b>In two years, I want to be 
                    extremely proficient in frontend technologies to undertake any project with minimal need 
                    for supervision and online research platforms e.g. YouTube, ChatGPT</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br><b><i>Secondly,</i></b> it has been a childhood dream to develop software of my design and ComBox 
                    has been a pet project idea for years. <b>By July 2026, I want to be skilled enough to 
                    design and build the frontend section of ComBox</b>. Also, <b>I want to be well-recognized 
                    in a community of tech professionals</b> to make it easy to collaborate and build the full 
                    project, and also market it as a product.
                    <br>
                    <br><b><i>In addition,</i></b> I want to <b>earn a minimum of $500 monthly working remotely as a frontend engineer</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br><b><i>Finally,</i></b> I want to <b>win a tech competition</b>.
